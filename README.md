## Description
Water company Vitens has created a demonstration site called the Vitens Innovation Playground (VIP), in which new technologies and methodologies are developed, tested, and demonstrated. The projects conducted in the demonstration site can be categorized into one of four themes: energy optimization, real-time leak detection, online water quality monitoring, and customer interaction. In the real-time leak detection theme, a method for leak detection based on statistical demand forecasting was developed.

Using historical demand patterns and statistical methods - such as median absolute deviation, linear regression, sample variance, and exponential moving averages - real-time values can be compared to a forecast demand pattern and checked to be within calculated bandwidths. The method was implemented in Vitens' realtime data historian, continuously comparing measured demand values to be within operational bounds.

One of the advantages of this method is that it doesn't require manual configuration or training sets. Next to leak detection, unmeasured supply between areas and unscheduled plant shutdowns were also detected. The method was found to be such a success within the company, that it was implemented in an operational dashboard and is now used in day-to-day operations.

### Keywords
Real-time, leak detection, demand forecasting, demand patterns, operational dashboard

## Samples

### Sample 1 - Forecast
![Sample 1](img/sample1.png)

In this example, two days before and after the current day are shown. For historic values, the measured data (black) is shown along with the forecast value (red). The upper and lower control limits (gray) were not crossed, so the DBM factor value (blue) equals zero. For future values, the forecast is shown along with the upper and lower control limits. Reliable forecasts can be made for at least seven days in advance.

### Sample 2 - Event
![Sample 2](img/sample2.png)

In this example, an event causes the measured value (black) to cross the upper control limit (gray). The DBM factor value (blue) is greater than one during this time (calculated as _(measured value - forecast value)/(upper control limit - forecast value)_).

### Sample 3 - Suppressed event (correlation)
![Sample 3a](img/sample3a.png)
![Sample 3b](img/sample3b.png)

In this example, an event causes the measured value (black) to cross the upper and lower control limits (gray). Because the pattern is checked against a similar pattern which has a comparable relative forecast error (calculated as _(forecast value / measured value) - 1_), the event is suppressed. The DBM factor value is reset to zero during this time.

### Sample 4 - Suppressed event (anticorrelation)
![Sample 4a](img/sample4a.png)
![Sample 4b](img/sample4b.png)

In this example, an event causes the measured value (black) to cross the lower control limit (gray). Because the pattern is checked against a similar, adjacent, pattern which has a comparable, but inverted, absolute forecast error (calculated as _forecast value - measured value_), the event is suppressed. The DBM factor value is reset to zero during this time.

### DBMDataRef
DBMDataRef is a custom OSIsoft PI Asset Framework data reference which integrates DBM with PI AF. The build script automatically registers the data reference and support assemblies when run on the PI AF server. The data reference uses the parent attribute as input and automatically uses attributes from sibling and parent elements based on the same template containing good data for correlation calculations, unless the `NoCorrelation` category is applied to the output attribute. The value returned from the DBM calculation is determined by the applied property/trait:

| Property/trait | Return value                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| None           | Factor                           |
| `Target`       | Measured value                   |
| `Forecast`     | Forecast value                   |
| `Minimum`      | Lower control limit (p = 0.9999) |
| `LoLo`         | Lower control limit (default)    |
| `Lo`           | Lower control limit (p = 0.95)   |
| `Hi`           | Upper control limit (p = 0.95)   |
| `HiHi`         | Upper control limit (default)    |
| `Maximum`      | Upper control limit (p = 0.9999) |
