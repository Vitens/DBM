    ' DBMRt is a real-time calculation module for OSIsoft PI ACE (Advanced
    ' Computing Engine). It is non-standard in that it does not use the
    ' Module Database for configuration, but instead dynamically searches for
    ' relevant PI tags and performs calculations on these when needed. Note
    ' that there is no support for manual or automatic recalculation.
