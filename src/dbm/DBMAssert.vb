    ' In computer programming, specifically when using the imperative
    ' programming paradigm, an assertion is a predicate (a Boolean-valued
    ' function over the state space, usually expressed as a logical proposition
    ' using the variables of a program) connected to a point in the program,
    ' that always should evaluate to true at that point in code execution.
    ' Assertions can help a programmer read the code, help a compiler compile
    ' it, or help the program detect its own defects.
    ' For the latter, some programs check assertions by actually evaluating the
    ' predicate as they run. Then, if it is not in fact true - an assertion
    ' failure -, the program considers itself to be broken and typically
    ' deliberately crashes or throws an assertion failure exception.
