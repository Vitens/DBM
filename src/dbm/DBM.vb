    ' Water company Vitens has created a demonstration site called the Vitens
    ' Innovation Playground (VIP), in which new technologies and methodologies
    ' are developed, tested, and demonstrated. The projects conducted in the
    ' demonstration site can be categorized into one of four themes: energy
    ' optimization, real-time leak detection, online water quality monitoring,
    ' and customer interaction. In the real-time leak detection theme, a method
    ' for leak detection based on statistical demand forecasting was developed.

    ' Using historical demand patterns and statistical methods - such as median
    ' absolute deviation, linear regression, sample variance, and exponential
    ' moving averages - real-time values can be compared to a forecast demand
    ' pattern and checked to be within calculated bandwidths. The method was
    ' implemented in Vitens' realtime data historian, continuously comparing
    ' measured demand values to be within operational bounds.

    ' One of the advantages of this method is that it doesn't require manual
    ' configuration or training sets. Next to leak detection, unmeasured supply
    ' between areas and unscheduled plant shutdowns were also detected. The
    ' method was found to be such a success within the company, that it was
    ' implemented in an operational dashboard and is now used in day-to-day
    ' operations.

    ' Vitens is the largest drinking water company in The Netherlands. We
    ' deliver top quality drinking water to 5.6 million people and companies in
    ' the provinces Flevoland, Fryslan, Gelderland, Utrecht and Overijssel and
    ' some municipalities in Drenthe and Noord-Holland. Annually we deliver 350
    ' million m3 water with 1,400 employees, 100 water treatment works and
    ' 49,000 kilometres of water mains.

    ' One of our main focus points is using advanced water quality, quantity and
    ' hydraulics models to further improve and optimize our treatment and
    ' distribution processes.
